**ARCHIVED!** This blog site has been archived. A future blog will become my main one to encompass more, but to ease the burden of lifting and shifting all the posts here it has been locked in netlify, the GitHub repo is being archived, and an archival site zip was extracted in case reconstruction is needed. Post comments are disabled (disqus was hit or miss for the past few years anyway) and there is an archival notice banner on the home and post pages.
